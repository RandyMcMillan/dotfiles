## Usage

### Basic Use Case

```shell
docker run --detach \
  --name git-server \
  --volume git-repositories:/srv/git \
  --publish 2222:22 \
  rockstorm/git-server
```

Your server should be accessible on port 2222 via:

```
git clone ssh://git@localhost:2222/srv/git/your-repo.git
```

The default password for the git user is `12345`.

#### Create a New Repository

Log into the server through SSH. Note the git user is constrained to
only a handful of commands, enough to list, create, delete, or rename
repositories, or change repository descriptions:

```shell
ssh git@localhost -p 2222
```

Create and initialise a repository at `/srv/git`:
```
mkdir /srv/git/your-repo.git
git-init --bare /srv/git/your-repo.git
```


### Use a Custom Password

Every container generated by this image has the same default password
set for the git user. You can set your own password using the
`GIT_PASSWORD` variable.

```shell
docker run --detach \
  --name git-server \
  --volume git-repositories:/srv/git \
  --env GIT_PASSWORD=your-password \
  --publish 2222:22 \
  rockstorm/git-server
```

To avoid specifying your password on the command line or on your
compose file, you can load it from a file using the
`GIT_PASSWORD_FILE`. This variable must be set to the file within the
container to load the password from.

```shell
docker run --detach \
  --name git-server \
  --volume git-repositories:/srv/git \
  --volume /path/to/password/file:/run/secrets/git_password:ro \
  --env GIT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/git_password \
  --publish 2222:22 \
  rockstorm/git-server
```

Or making use of Docker secrets on your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    environment:
      GIT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/git_password
    secrets:
      - git_password
secrets:
  git_password:
    file: /path/to/password/file
```


## Advanced configuration

A [sample `docker-compose.yml`][4] is provided with all available
options to use with docker-compose.

[4]: https://github.com/rockstorm101/git-server-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml.sample

### Use SSH public keys

The most secure option is to disable clear text passwords completely
and only allow connections via SSH public keys.

First, Set to 'no' the following option on the [sample `sshd_config`][5]:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Second, mount your custom `sshd_config`. Via docker-compose.yml is
done like:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./sshd_config.sample:/etc/ssh/sshd_config:ro
```

Third, you need to mount the file with SSH authentication keys for
the users that will be allowed to interact with the server. These are
set in the docker-compose.yml file as:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/authorized_keys:/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys:ro
```

[5]: https://github.com/rockstorm101/git-server-docker/blob/master/sshd_config.sample

#### Create Authorised Keys File

SSH key generation for your client machine to connect to the
server is detailed in depth on [Git's book Chapter 4.3][6].

Then simply copy the contents of all allowed clients' `id_*.pub` into
a file and mount it as detailed above.

[6]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key

#### Allow Both SSH Public Key and Password

Add the following line to your `sshd_config` to allow either a public
key login _or_ a password login:

```
AuthenticationMethods publickey password
```


### Custom SSH Host Keys

The default host keys are generated during image build and are the
same for every container which uses this image. This is a security
risk and therefore the use of a custom set of keys is highly
recommended. This will also ensure keys are persistent if the image is
upgraded.

To enable custom SSH host keys set the `SSH_HOST_KEYS_PATH` variable
to a location such as `/tmp/host-keys` and mount a folder with your
custom keys on the server. The setup process will replace the default
keys with these ones. This would look like the following on your
docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    environment:
      SSH_HOST_KEYS_PATH: /tmp/host-keys
    volumes:
      - /path/to/host-keys:/tmp/host-keys:ro
```


### Enable Git URLs Without Absolute Path

By default, git URLs to you repositories will be in the form of:

```
git clone ssh://git@example.com:2222/srv/git/project/repository.git
```

By setting the environment variable `REPOSITORIES_HOME_LINK` to
e.g. `/srv/git/project` a link will be created into the git user home
directory so that your git URLs don't require the repository absolute
path[^1]:

```
git clone ssh://git@example.com:2222/project/repository.git
```

To configure this on your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    environment:
      REPOSITORIES_HOME_LINK: /srv/git
```

To avoid specifying ports on git URLs you can configure your client
machine by adding the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```
Host my-server
    HostName example.com
    User git
    Port 2222
```

This way your git URLs would look like:

```
git clone my-server:project/repository.git
```

### Disable Git User Interactive Login

To disable the interactive SSH login for the git user and limit it to
only git clone, push and pull actions, mount a file onto
`/home/git/git-shell-commands/no-interactive-login`. This file must be
executable. When the git user attempts to login, this file is run and
the interactive shell is aborted. This is set in the
docker-compose.yml file as:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /executable/file:/home/git/git-shell-commands/no-interactive-login:ro
```

### Set Git User UID / GID

The variables `GIT_USER_UID` and `GIT_USER_GID` allow you to customise
the UID and GID of the git user inside the container. This could be
useful if the host is administered by a non-root user and you would
like the git user to have the same UID (This would allow not having to
restart the container to reset file permissions on files created by a
host user). If `GIT_USER_UID` is defined but `GIT_USER_GID` isn't, the
latter is assumed to be equal to the first. To configure this on your
docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    environment:
      GIT_USER_UID: 1001
```

### Setup logging

This image will produce no logs by default. To output logging to
stderr configure your docker-compose.yml like:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    command: ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-e"]
```

If you add a custom command, be sure to include `/usr/sbin/sshd -D`
for the git server to stay in the foreground, otherwise your container
will stop immediately after starting.


## Variants

All images are based on the latest stable image of [Alpine Linux][7].

### `git-server:<git-version>`

Default image. It contains just git and SSH.

### `git-server:<git-version>-docker`

This image includes the Docker CLI. With this addition the git server
will be able to start other containers for things such as running
CI/CD actions. In this case you would need to mount the host's Docker
socket to your git server container[^2]. This would look like the
following on your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  git-server:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Tagging Scheme

 - **'X.Y+bZ'**: Immutable tag. Points to a specific image build and will
   not be reused.

 - **'X.Y'**: Stable tag for specific Git major and minor versions. It
   follows the latest build for Git version X.Y and therefore changes
   on every patch change (i.e. 1.2.3 to 1.2.4), on every change on
   OpenSSH and every change on the base Alpine image.

 - **'latest'**: This tag follows the very latest build regardless any
   major/minor versions.
