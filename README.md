# climake 

The simplistic, dependency-free cli library âœ¨

- **[Documentation](https://docs.rs/climake)**
- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/climake)

---

This branch represents the unpublished rewrite version of climake with many advantages compared to the original version which is no longer developed upon!

## Example ðŸ“š

Demo of a simple package manager:

```rust
use climake::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let package = Argument::new(
        "The package name",
        vec!['p', 'i'],
        vec!["pkg, package"],
        Input::Text,
    );

    let add = Subcommand::new("add", vec![&package], vec![], "Adds a package");
    let rem = Subcommand::new("rem", vec![&package], vec![], "Removes a package");

    let cli = CliMake::new(
        "MyPkg",
        vec![],
        vec![&add, &rem],
        "A simple package manager demo",
        "1.0.0",
    );

    let parsed = cli.parse();

    for subcommand in parsed.subcommands {
        if subcommand.inner == &add {
            println!("Adding package {:?}..", subcommand.arguments[0]);
        } else if subcommand.inner == &rem {
            println!("Removing package {:?}..", subcommand.arguments[0]);
        }
    }
}
```

## Installation ðŸš€

Simply add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
climake = "3.0.0-pre.1" # rewrite isn't out just yet!
```

# Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE-MIT.txt}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Hereâ€™s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Mathias Bynens"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mathias@mailinator.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. Itâ€™s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
```

### Install native apps with `brew cask`

You could also install native apps with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
brew bundle ~/Caskfile
```
