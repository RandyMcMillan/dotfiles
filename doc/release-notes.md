How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from very old versions of Bitcoin Core or Knots is possible,
but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Knots are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS
13+, and Windows 10+. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Knots on
unsupported systems.

Known Bugs
==========

In various locations, including the GUI's transaction details dialog and the
`"vsize"` result in many RPC results, transaction virtual sizes may not account
for an unusually high number of sigops (ie, as determined by the
`-bytespersigop` policy) or datacarrier penalties (ie, `-datacarriercost`).
This could result in reporting a lower virtual size than is actually used for
mempool or mining purposes.

Due to disruption of the shared Bitcoin Transifex repository, this release
still does not include updated translations, and Bitcoin Knots may be unable
to do so until/unless that is resolved.

Notable changes
===============

Numerous wallet bugs have been fixed, including some obscure scenarios that
could delete the wallet (n.b. the ordinary-use disaster in Core 30 never
affected Knots). As a side effect, unsupported BDB versions (any other than
exactly 4.8 may experience reduced compatibility.
