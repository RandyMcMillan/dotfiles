Bitcoin Knots version 29.3.knots20260507 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoinknots.org/files/29.x/29.3.knots20260507/>

This release includes new features, default configuration changes, and various
bug fixes. However, it does not support the upcoming BIP110/RDTS network
upgrade ([**IMPORTANT INFORMATION BELOW**](#not-supported-reduced-data-temporary-softfork)).

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

How to Upgrade
==============

**Before upgrading,** read [the Reduced Data Temporary Softfork section below](#reduced-data-temporary-softfork),
and if you run the bitcoind server, be sure to add the `consensusrules=rdts`
parameter to your `bitcoin.conf` file.

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from very old versions of Bitcoin Core or Knots is possible,
but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Knots are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS
13+, and Windows 10+. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Knots on
unsupported systems.

Known Bugs
==========

In various locations, including the GUI's transaction details dialog and the
`"vsize"` result in many RPC results, transaction virtual sizes may not account
for an unusually high number of sigops (ie, as determined by the
`-bytespersigop` policy) or datacarrier penalties (ie, `-datacarriercost`).
This could result in reporting a lower virtual size than is actually used for
mempool or mining purposes.

Due to disruption of the shared Bitcoin Transifex repository, this release
still does not include updated translations, and Bitcoin Knots may be unable
to do so until/unless that is resolved.

### NOT Supported: Reduced Data Temporary Softfork

This version of Bitcoin Knots does not support the upcoming BIP110 (RDTS) network upgrade, which fixes critical vulnerabilities in long-standing network design.

Important: Because this upgrade already has broad community support, continuing to run older versions (such as this version) does not reject it. Running outdated software after any network upgrade only leaves your node vulnerable to displaying fake or fraudulent transactions. To effectively reject this upgrade, you need to run alternative software designed to split away from the upgraded network.

To adopt this upgrade and remain secure, please update Bitcoin Knots:

Notable changes
===============

### Default configuration changes

- When `-dbcache` is not set explicitly, Bitcoin Knots now chooses a RAM-aware
  default between 100 MiB and 2 GiB. The selected `-dbcache` value is still
  used for both IBD and steady-state operation and unused mempool allocation
  may be shared with this cache. In environments with external memory limits
  (e.g. containers), automatic sizing may not match effective limits. The
  previous behavior can be restored by setting `-dbcache` explicitly. (#34641)

### New spam filters

- Transactions creating outputs with a value less than the expected value to
  spend them (ie, "dust") are now treated by policy as if those outputs had a
  value at least meeting that threshold by having their effective fees reduced
  by the difference. This only affects transactions otherwise allowed by your
  node policy (it does not expand the range of accepted transactions), so
  typically this only applies to datacarrier or anchor outputs. It is enabled
  by default, and can be disabled with `subdustfeepenalty=0` (or the GUI
  option) in your configuration. (knots#272)

- Datacarrier policy options now match a newer variation of spam designed to
  bypass the prior implementation. (knots#292)

### New features

- The `sweepprivkeys` RPC method now looks for segwit (p2wpkh) and taproot
  (p2tr) UTXOs, in addition to the older p2pk and p2pkh formats. (knots#296)

- "Sweep private key" dialog added to the GUI (File menu) for easy access.
  (knots#297)

### P2P and network changes

- Tor hidden services that are created automatically by Bitcoin Knots will have
  [PoW defenses](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/onion-services/ecosystem/technology/security/pow/)
  enabled if the Tor daemon supports that. (#33414)
