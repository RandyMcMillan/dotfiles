    //! isn't an immediate need, because the protocol implementation can clean

    //! @note: If this method is called, it needs be called before connect()
    //! because for ease of implementation it's inflexible and always runs the
    //! event loop in the foreground thread. It can share its event loop with
    //! connect() but can't share an event loop that was created by connect().
    //! This isn't really a problem because serve() is only called by spawned
    //! child processes that call it immediately to communicate back with parent
    //! processes.
